My thoughts on the positives and negatives of working in a group.
Working in a group offers different perspectives and input towards problem solving, making it much easier and less stressful to complete the assignment. Through working on the easier problems separately and the larger and more time consuming problems together, it takes less time as a whole to finish the assignment, allowing more time to finalize and improve our final product.
The negatives of working in a group include time availability for all group members to meet up due to busy schedules, slight inefficiency in terms of dividing the group work and management of files.
